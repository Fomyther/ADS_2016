Consider only the zip codes having more than 500 houses to consider. Train the model over as many relevant regressors as you can (including dummy-variables expressing impact of non-real valued factors or non-linear impacts) and perform feature selection over the validaton set. This is a custom approach - feel free to frame it as you like aiming for the best possible performance over the validation sets. Report the final training and validation set R2's as a table (zip, size, R2) as well as a spatial visualization (just the validation R2 over zip code's lat-long with colors indicating the R2 value).
